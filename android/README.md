# K-Wallet
K-Wallet project is for demonstrating the easiness of Android Jetpack Compose.
(So I will firstly focus on Android app, and if I have time after finishing the Android one, perhaps will developing iOS one later)


## Tech stack
The project will use the following technologies.

1. Mobile
1 Android
- Jetpack Compose
- Coil
- Retrofit
- Coruotine (Flow, Channel)
- Jetpack Navigation
- Firebase (Push Notification/AB Testing, etc)
- gRPC (Network)

2. iOS
- TBD

3. Backend
- Container: Spring boot (kotlin)
- Database: MySQL
- Firebase
- Redis


# Timeline
As I'm a sole developer, I'm going to develop Android first, and use mock data(it pretends the our backend server) first.
After that, will implement the backend.

So the deadline of the Android app without backend implementation is due by end of 2021. (perhaps 17th Dec 2021)

# Branch Strategy
I'll use the Gitflow for managing subtasks.

# Sprints
One sprint has 3 days.
After 3 days, there is a one day for fixing trivial issues.
